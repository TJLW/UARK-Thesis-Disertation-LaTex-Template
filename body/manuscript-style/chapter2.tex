\chapter{Scientific Background}

This chapter can be used as your literature reveiw chapter and to include any
information on scientific theories that are particularly relevant to your
research. Here is an example of and equation.
%
\begin{equation}
    F_{es} = -\frac{1}{2} \int \epsilon(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{E}^2(\mathbf{r}) dr
    \label{esfnrg}
\end{equation}
%
where $\epsilon(\mathbf{r})$ is the dielectric constant at position
$\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$ is the electric field at the same
position. The equation can be referenced like this \ref{esfnrg}.
